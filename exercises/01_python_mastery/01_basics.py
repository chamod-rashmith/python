"""
Exercise 1: Basic Math & Logic
Goal: Write a script that asks the user for two numbers and prints their sum, difference, and product.
Then, check if the sum is greater than 100.
"""

# Hint: use input() to get user input.
# Remember that input() returns a string, so you'll need to convert it using int() or float().

# Your code goes here...

# Example completion criteria:
# 1. Ask for first number
# 2. Ask for second number
# 3. Print Sum, Diff, Product
# 4. Print "Big Number!" if Sum > 100

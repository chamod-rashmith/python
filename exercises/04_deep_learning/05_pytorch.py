# Task 1: Create a tensor 'w' (weight) with value 5.0 and 'b' (bias) with value 2.0.
# Both must have requires_grad=True.

# Task 2: Create an input 'x' with value 10.0.

# Task 3: Calculate y = w * x + b.

# Task 4: Define a target 'y_true' = 100.0. Calculate the 'Loss' as (y - y_true)**2.

# Task 5: Run loss.backward() and print the gradient of 'w'.
# What does this gradient tell you about how to change 'w' to reduce the loss?
